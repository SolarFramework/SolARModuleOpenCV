= SolARSVDTriangulation test

This program demonstrates an OpenCV implementation of triangulation as specified by "ITriangulator.h" in SolARFramework.
It requires, as input, two sets of 2D-points for two images and the corresponding camera poses, camera calibration matrix and camera distortion parameters. It produces a set of triangulated 3D-points in the world coordinates system


== Input files
The program does not need input parameters but must *be run in the project* directory "SolARSVDtriangulation" as it uses the following input text files (hard coded) :

* *dist.txt* : contains the camera distortion parameters

* *K.txt* : contains the camera calibration matrix parameters

* *pt1_F.txt* : contains a set of 2D-points in the camera coordinates system for the first image

* *pt2_F.txt* : contains a set of 2D-points in the camera coordinates system for the second image

* *pose_1.txt* : contains the pose of the camera in the world coordinate system for the first image

* *pose_2.txt* : contains the pose of the camera in the world coordinate system for the second image



== Output file

The 3D-points resulting from the triangulation are stored in *solar_cloud.txt* in the working directory : first the number of 3-D points, then one set of World coordinates per line.
